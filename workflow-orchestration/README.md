In this project, I containerized the orchestration process for an independent architecture

The container is connected to the network in pipeline file and is able to run queries in Kestra flow, see flows/verify_ny_taxi_connection.yaml

In the flows/03_getting_started_data_pipeline, add another columns when executing the flow and output the average price for each category instead of brand
